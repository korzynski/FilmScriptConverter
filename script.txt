FADE IN

SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE:

INT. ENGINE ROOM

Empty, cavernous.

INT. ENGINE CUBICLE

Circular, jammed with instruments. All of them idle. Console chairs for two. Empty.

INT. OILY CORRIDOR - "C" LEVEL

Long, dark. Empty. Turbos throbbing. No other movement.

INT. CORRIDOR - "A" LEVEL

Long, empty.

INT. INFIRMARY - "A" LEVEL

Distressed ivory walls. All instrumentation at rest.

INT. CORRIDOR TO BRIDGE - "A" LEVEL

Black, empty.

INT. BRIDGE

Vacant. Two space helmets resting on chairs. Electrical hum. Lights on the helmets begin to signal one another. Moments of silence. A yellow light goes on. Data mind bank in b.g. Electronic hum. A green light goes on in front of one helmet. Electronic pulsing sounds. A red light goes on in front of other helmet. An electronic conversation ensues. Reaches a crescendo. Then silence. The lights go off, save the yellow.

INT. CORRIDOR TO HYPERSLEEP VAULT

Lights come on. Seven gowns hang from the curved wall. Vault door opens.

INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT

Explosion of escaping gas. The lids on the freezers pop open. Slowly, groggily, KANE sits up. Pale. Kane rubs the sleep from his eyes. Stands. Looks around. Stretches. Looks at the other freezer compartments. Scratches. Moves off.

INT. MESS

The crew of the United States commercial starship Nostromo seated around a table.

Dallas.........Captain Kane...........Executive Officer Ripley.........Warrant Officer Ash............Science Officer Lambert........Navigator Parker.........Engineer Brett..........Engineering Technician Jones..........Cat

Five men and two women: Lambert and Ripley.

Parker's laughing and there is indecipherable talking (walla)

BRETT

(01:06:36:10)

This is the worst shit I've ever seen man.

PARKER

(01:06:40:11)

What'choo say? Have you got any bisquets over there?

RIPLEY

(01:06:43:10)

Here's some corn bread.

PARKER

(01:06:46:XX)

Cornbread, yeah.

LAMBERT

(01:06:48:00)

I am cold.

PARKER

(01:06:49:20)

Still with us, Brett?

BRETT

(01:06:52:XX)

Right.

O.S. PARKER

Yeah.

KANE

I feel dead.

PARKER

Anybody ever tell you you look dead, man?

Everyone chuckles and laughs. Brett puts his hand to his mouth to signal Parker.

BRETT

(whispering to Parker)

Bond...

PARKER

Oh, yeah, right. I just forgot something man. Uh, before we dock, I think we oughta discuss the bonus situation.

BRETT

Right.

PARKER

Brett and I think we deserve full shares.

BRETT

Right. You see, Mr. Parker and I feel the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level.

DALLAS

Well, you'll get what you contracted for like everybody else.

BRETT

Yes but everybody else gets more than us.

A beeping is heard from behind Dallas.

ASH

Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.

Dallas is getting out of his seat and puts on his over shirt.

DALLAS

Yeah, I saw it. Yellow light's for my eyes only... Ok, get dressed, huh? Parker, let's go.

Ash shovles down the last bit of his food and gets up.

PARKER

Can I finish my coffee? It's the only thing good on this ship.

INT. BRIDGE

Dallas is standing in the doorway to the bridge finishing the last of his coffee. The rest of the crew is heard in the other room. Dallas walks over to a far door and presses a button, the door raises, he walks in.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM ANNEX

Floor to ceiling data banks. Dallas turns on a light over an enclosed key holder. He presses his thumb to the button and it lets out a computer beep while it reads his finger print. He punches in his 4 digit cote and a little door swings open. He grabs the key out, sticks it in a slot and another door opens, he pushes a button inside and the computer starts beeping at him then opens the door to the main annex.

He enters the main annex, there are floor to ceiling flashing lights. Dallas sits down at the station and starts typing into the computer.

O.S. DALLAS

Good morning Mother.

All banks burst into life. Dallas punches up a computer code on the keyboard. A legend underneath. COMMAND PRIORITY ACCESS ONLY. Dallas punches up the combination on the keyboard. Immediately start getting a readout.

CUT TO:

INT. BRIDGE

Above eye level the room is ringed by viewscreens. All of them blank. Kane, Ripley, and Lambert enter. Dallas' seat remains empty. All of them now dressed; they find their way to individual consoles. Ripley puts down the cat, straps herself into the high- backed chair.

RIPLEY

(01:09:05:05)

Right?

kane

(01:09:05:17)

Ok...

Kane's seat slides forward.

KANE

(01:09:07:21)

Plug us in.

All three crew members begin throwing switches. The control room starts to come to life. Colored lights flicker. Chase each other across glowing screens.

Ash

(01:09:10:10)

Thank you.

LAMBERT

(01:09:16:24)

Where's Earth?

KANE

(01:09:17:28)

You should know.

RIPLEY

(01:09:20:25)

It's not our system.

KANE

(01:09:24:00)

Scan.

Lambert hits several toggles. On the screens the images begin to drift.

LAMBERT

(01:09:27:13 Deep sigh, muttering under her breath)

I can't believe this.

KAne

(01:09:30:20)

Contact traffic control.

CUT TO:

EXT. NOSTROMO

The Factory Starship lumbering with the depths of inter-stellar space.

INT. BRIDGE

RIPLEY

(01:09:56:27)

Nothing.

kane

(01:09:59:34)

Keep trying.

RIPLEY

(01:09:59:52 continues)

Calling air traffic control. Do you read me antarctica? over.

 LAMBERT

(01:10:00:35 quietly)

Working on it.


LAMBERT

(01:10:04:28)

Found it. Just short of Zeta 2 Reticuli. We haven't reached the outer rim yet.

KANE

(01:1011:04)

That's Hard to believe.

o.s. RIPLEY

Calling Antarctica traffic control. Do you read me? Over.

LAMBERT

(01:10:15:00 )

What the hell are we doing out here?

KANE

(01:10:18:08)

I dunno. What the hell are you talking about?

RIPLEY

(01:10:21:10)

That's not our system.

LAMBERT

(01:10:22:59 sarcastic)

I know that.

INT. OILY CORRIDOR - "C" LEVEL

Parker and Brett walking down a walkway. Engines are thumping and humming all around

PARKER

(01:10:25:09)

Listen, Ya ever notice how they never come down here.I mean,this is where the work is, right?

BRETT

(01:10:30:18)

Same damn reason we have half a share to their one, our time is their time, that's the way they see it. Same ole shit man.

PARKER

(01:10:35:22)

But... but... Listen, man.

PARKER

(01:10:38:05)

But I think I know why they don't come down here. It's because of you. You don't have no personality. No...

They move towards the companionway.

INT. MESS

Entire crew present.

BRETT

(01:10:45:15)

So what the hell is going on down here?

PARKER

(01:10:50:01)

Umm, man, you happen to be in my seat. Can I have my seat? Thank you.

ash

(01:10:51:27)

Oh, yes of course.

PARKER

(01:11:00:15)

What's happening now, baby?

DALLAS

(01:11:04:05)

Well, Some of you may have figured out that we're not home. We're only halfway there.

PARKER

(01:11:09:21)

What?

DALLAS

(01:11:11:14)

Mother's interrupted the course of our journey.

Sighs from the crew.

kane

(01:11:14:13)

Why?

brett

(01:11:15:00)

Yeah.

Murmurs from unhappy crew.

DALLAS

(01:11:15:02)

She's programmed to interrupt the course of our journey if certain conditions arise. They have...

RIPLEY

(01:11:19:19)

Like what?

DALLAS

(01:11:20:11)

It seems she has intercepted a transmission of unknown origin. She got us up to check it out.

RIPLEY

(01:11:26:06)

A transmission? out here?

LAMBERT

(01:11:28:29)

Lambert what kind of a transmission?

DALLAS

(01:11:31:20)

An acoustical beacon that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds.

kane

(01:11:34:06)

An SOS?

DALLAS

(01:11:35:27)

I don't know.

RIPLEY

(01:11:37:03)

Human?

DALLAS

(01:11:37:26)

Unknown

brett

(01:11:40:06)

So what?

kane

(01:11:41:28)

We're obligated under Section B2...

PARKER

(01:11:44:02)

I hate to bring this up. This is a commerical ship not some rescue ship.

brett

(01:11:48:25)

Right

PARKER

(01:11:49:21)

And it's not in my contract to do this kind of duty. And what about the money? if you wanna give me some money to do it, I'll be happy to uh, ya know oblige. Let's go over the bond situation, We never go over...can we talk about the bond situation? Let's talk about the bond situation. the bond situation.

Parker continues to ramble on about the bond situation.

ash

(01:12:00:20)

I'm sorry. Can I? Can I just say something? There is a clause in the contract which specifically states that any systematized transmission indicating of possible intelligent origin must be investigated.

PARKER

(01:12:10L18)

I don't wanna hear it.

brett

(01:12:10:16)

We don't know that it's intelligent

PARKER

(01:12:12:01)

I just wanna go home and party.

dallas

(01:12:12:15)

will you just listen to the man!

ash

(01:12:17:04)

Or a penalty of total forfeiture of shares...01:12:21:06 No money.

Dallas gives Parker and Brett a look.

DALLAS

(01:12:23:15)

Ya got that?

PARKER

(01:12:24:23 chuckling)

Well... yeah.

DALLAS

(01:12:27:16)

We're going in, that's it.

PARKER

(01:12:28:15 smiling)

Yeah - we're going in.
